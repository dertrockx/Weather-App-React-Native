# Weather App using React Native

* Yeah, this is another one of those beginner projects for react native. But hey, it's a start - and I'm proud of this. It's my first ever native app.
* Thanks to expo cli, I developed this on my phone. No need for a powerful laptop to run an emulator, thanks to expo.
